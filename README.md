# Personalized Text Classification for Sports Rehabilitation in Precision Medicine

## Overview
This repository hosts the implementation of a novel computational framework for **personalized sports rehabilitation**. By leveraging real-time data, biomechanical modeling, and adaptive AI strategies, our system aims to revolutionize recovery protocols and optimize athletic performance through the lens of **precision medicine**.

## Motivation
Traditional rehabilitation protocols follow a one-size-fits-all approach, often overlooking individual differences in:

- Biomechanics
- Recovery trajectories
- Neuromuscular feedback
- Psychological and cognitive factors

This can lead to prolonged recovery, increased reinjury risks, and reduced performance outcomes. Our framework addresses this gap by integrating **personalized intelligence** into rehabilitation programming.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Biomechanical Rehabilitation Model (ABRM)**:
  - Dynamically adjusts training load, rest periods, and exercise intensity.
  - Optimizes rehabilitation planning in real-time using reinforcement learning and predictive modeling.

- **Multimodal Data Integration**:
  - Combines biomechanical sensor input, neuromuscular feedback, and clinical assessments.
  - Enables comprehensive and individualized decision-making.

- **Reinforcement Learning-Based Exercise Prescription**:
  - Learns from real-time physiological signals to recommend personalized exercises and adjustments.

- **Continuous Feedback Loop**:
  - Ensures ongoing adaptation based on patient responses and progress.
